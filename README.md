This project is loosely based on an Appsrox.com tutorial "Build your first pro Android application with Eclipse" by Sovelluksen Valmistaja. I am using it as both a place to showcase my Android skills, and as a workspace to practice certain features.

The original tutorial is to create an app in Eclipse. I am using Android Studio 1.4, instead.
